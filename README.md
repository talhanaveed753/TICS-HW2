# TICS-HW2
Assignment 2: API, JSON, HTML, JavaScript

This project accesses an API endpoint containing data. It takes that data and organizes it into a data table in a easy to read fashion.
The HTML file includes important elements such as making the table and headers centered on the page as well as adding shadows to offer
a more refined asthetic.


Included below are some screenshots and links to different parts of the repository containing my code:
